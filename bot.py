""" The bot.py module encapsulates the logic for all bot activity. 

Bots are autonomous programs typically run as background process.

All bots inherit from the `bot` class. Currently, one class called
`sendbot` has been implemented. It is intended to run as a background
process which monitors the message dispatch queue. When a dispatch is
placed in the queue, sendbot picks it up and sends it to the
`dispatcher` effectively sending the message out to the recipients.

At the moment, other bots are planned, such as a sysadmin bot which
will monitor production and development environments, and a
configuration manager bot which will automate the task of setting up
environments and deploying code to production.

A `bot` is an `ecommerce.agents` and therefore ultimately derives
from `party.party`. Bots have their own user account (bot.user) under
which most of their activities are run.

Bots log their activity to the database via the apriori.log entity. The
`verbosity` argument controls how much is logged.

Bots are intended to be run as their own process, typically through
systemd, so they are invoked like any other program, e.g., 

    ./bot.py --iterations 1 --verbosity 5 sendbot

Here, the bot.py binary is being run. At the end, we can see that a
particual bot, 'sendbot', is being invoked. The global argument
--iteration is set to 1, meaning the sendbot will check and process the
dispatch queue 1 time and then exit. This is typical for debugging
purposes; in production we would not set `iterations` in order that
sendobt iterates indefinately.  The verbosity is set to 5 because we
want to see all the output. In production, that much logging may be
unnecessary. Note that when logging, the bot will print log messages to
the screen and record them to the database at the same time.
