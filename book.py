        Whether you're adding a feature to the ORM, creating a nwe web

        battery of automated tests.

        Virtually everything gets a test in the framework from the
        simple to the complex, so it makes sense to start with a
        discussion on writting tests.

        Included with the framework is a module called, simply enough,
        `tester.py`. It has most of the features that you may be familiar
        with from other test framworks, such as Python's builtin
        `unittest`. In addition to the standard assert methods, it
        includes a `browser` for the purpose of running tests against
        websites, a `benchmark` subclass for performance testing, and
        other useful, framework specific features.
